  <p>Once you master the basics of authoring HTML, you&rsquo;ll need focus on what your next steps will be. If
    you&rsquo;re an aspiring web designer, you&rsquo;ll need to dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If
    you&rsquo;re maintaining a corporate or personal site through a CMS, you&rsquo;ll need to focus on how the CMS
    works, and the most efficient ways to edit and maintain content. On this page I&rsquo;ll give you some basic advice
    on how to approach learning web design and point you towards additional resources that can help you along the way.

  <h3>Learning Web Design</h3>
  <p><em>&ldquo;Web design&rdquo;</em> is a pretty open-ended term. Often people who are new to web design feel
    overwhelmed at
    everything there is to learn. That&rsquo;s understandable, but just remember that it&rsquo;s like any other
    discipline; with proper dedication and focus you&rsquo;ll progress quickly. Here&rsquo;s my favorite advice to new
    web designers on learning web design:</p>
  <!--  -->
  <p><strong>Learn how the web works.</strong><br>
    I&rsquo;m always <em>amazed</em> at how many web designers focus on learning &ldquo;just what they need to
    know&rdquo; and
    ignore how the web actually works. Without understanding how web servers, protocols, browsers, and other related web
    technology works, you&rsquo;ll never really understand the context behind why you do the things you do, and what
    makes one practice better than another.</p>
  <!--  -->
  <p><strong>Determine an area of focus, and start there.</strong><br>
    There are a lot of areas of web design that you could specialize in, so I&rsquo;d recommend <b>learning</b> as much
    about
    them as you can, to determine which areas interest <strong>YOU</strong>. Then, spend as much time learning about
    your specific area
    of focus as possible. Once you achieve a level of proficiency, begin to branch out into other areas as well. </p>
  <!--  -->
  <p><strong>Never stop learning</strong><br>
    The web is <strong> constantly evolving.</strong> Even if you become the absolute best there is in a specific field,
    chances are new
    techniques and approaches will come along within the year that will make your current skill set less desirable.
    Understand that being a good web designer means embracing the changing nature of the web.</p>
  <!--  -->
  <p><strong>Break things!</strong><br>
    There is <b>NO</b> better teacher than <em>experience.</em> Build and experiment constantly. Ask yourself,<i>
      &ldquo;what would happen
      if I?...&rdquo;</i> or <i>&ldquo;wonder if I could build?...&rdquo;</i> and then go out and build it. If
    you&rsquo;re like me,
    you&rsquo;ll fail a good bit of the time, but the process of trying things and breaking them will make you that much
    better.<em> Always challenge yourself.</em></p>
